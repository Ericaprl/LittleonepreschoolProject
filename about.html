            <p class="text-justify">For 30 years, our Little One Preschool, located in Blacrock, has marked the history of Dublin as
              an Institution that educates with quality and prepares its students to face the challenges of
              educational life, preparing them to live in society.
              We offer courses in Early Childhood Education and Early Years Elementary Education.
              Our team of educators has 100 well-prepared and qualified professionals to carry out their mission.
              It is at school that we acquire knowledge, make friends and learn values. Feeling belonging to something
              is very important for the trajectory of the human being. Everyone who knows us feels the welcome and
              affection of this humanizing and excellent education.
