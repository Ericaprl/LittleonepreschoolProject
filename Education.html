            <h1> What is Montessori Education? </h1>

            <p class="text-justify"> Montessori is a method of education that is based on self-directed activity,
                hands-on learning and
                collaborative
                play.
                In Montessori classrooms children make creative choices in their learning, while the classroom and the
                highly
                trained teacher offer age-appropriate activities to guide the process. Children work in groups and
                individually
                to discover and explore knowledge of the world and to develop their maximum potential.

            </p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Montessori classrooms are beautifully crafted environments designed to meet the
                needs of children in a
                specific
                age range.
                Dr. Maria Montessori discovered that experiential learning in this type of classroom led to a deeper
                understanding of language, mathematics, science, music, social interactions and much more. Most
                Montessori
                classrooms are secular in nature, although the Montessori educational method can be integrated
                successfully
                into
                a faith-based program.

            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Every material in a Montessori classroom supports an aspect of child development,
                creating a match between
                the
                child's natural interests and the available activities.
                Children can learn through their own experience and at their own pace. They can respond at any moment to
                the
                natural curiosities that exist in all humans and build a solid foundation for life-long learning.

            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) was established by Maria Montessori
                in 1929 to protect the
                integrity of her work and to support high standards for both teacher training and schools.
                Today, AMI continues to uphold Maria Montessori's vision while collaborating with contemporary research
                in
                neuroscience and child development. Montessori Northwest is proud to be an official teacher training
                center
                of
                AMI, training teachers to work with children from birth to age twelve.

            <h1>Who Was Maria Montessori? </h1>
            <img src="images/maria1.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="Maria" class="img-fluid" id="imgMaria">

            <p class="text-justify">Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952) was an Italian physician and anthropologist who
                devoted her life to
                understanding how children develop socially, intellectually, physically, and spiritually. By carefully
                observing
                children all over the world, she discovered universal patterns of development which are found in all
                children
                regardless of their culture or the era in which they live.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"> Dr. Montessori was one of the first women to be granted a diploma as a physician in
                Italy. Following her
                interest in human development, she assisted at a clinic for children with mental illnesses. She later
                directed
                the Orthophrenic School in Rome for children with physical, mental and emotional challenges. During this
                time
                Dr. Montessori lectured throughout Europe concerning the needs of children and their value to the future
                of
                our
                societies. She stressed the need to change our attitudes about children and their treatment.</p>


            <p class="text-justify">In 1907, Dr. Montessori was given the responsibility of caring for a group of
                children in the Rome's San
                Lorenzo
                slum district. She began to see the importance of a positive, nurturing environment that changes with
                the
                developmental needs of the child. As she observed the children and their response to the environment,
                she
                saw
                them demonstrate capabilities and interests that exceeded her expectations. The set of materials used in
                the
                "Montessori" environment were designed over a period of many years by Dr. Maria Montessori and her
                associates,
                creating a concrete, physical representation of the concepts and skills that children are naturally
                motivated to
                learn in their normal course of development.</p>


            <p class="text-justify">Dr. Montessori conducted her first international training course in Italy in 1913,
                and her first American
                training course in California in 1915. As she carried her vision around the world, she felt that a time
                had
                come
                to ensure the quality and integrity of what was being handed down in her training courses. For that
                reason,
                she
                founded the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) in 1929. Today AMI continues to support quality
                teacher
                training worldwide.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"> Maria Montessori was a visionary, not easily daunted by the many challenges she
                faced during her career. She
                traveled extensively, lecturing and teaching throughout Europe, India and in the United States. She was
                recognized for her efforts by educators, psychologists and political leaders of the day. Her associates
                included
                such people as Anna Freud, Erik Erikson, Mahatma Gandhi, Alexander Graham Bell and Jean Piaget.

            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Dr. Montessori was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949, 1950 and 1951 and
                continued working, teaching
                and writing up to the time of her death. Over the past one hundred years children throughout the world
                have
                benefited from this educational approach that supports, nurtures, and protects natural development.
                Maria
                Montessori's legacy lives on in the children whose lives are touched by her discoveries about life.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">In her own words:
                <img src="images/maria2.jpg" class="rounded float-left" alt="Maria 2" id="imgMaria2">


                "My vision of the future is no longer of people taking exams and proceeding on that certification... but
                of
                individuals passing from one stage of independence to a higher, by means of their own activity, through
                their
                own effort of will, which constitutes the inner evolution of the individual." - Introduction, From
                Childhood
                to
                Adolescence, Clio <br>

                “… The children themselves found a sentence that expressed this inner need. “Help me to do it by
                myself!”
                How
                eloquent is this paradoxical request! …It is in this that our conception differs both from that of the
                world
                in
                which the adult does everything for the child and from that of a passive environment in which the adult
                abandons
                the child to himself” - The Secret of Childhood, p. 213 <br>

                “I have served the spirits of those children, and they have fulfilled their development, and I kept them

            <h1>Inside a Montessori Classroom</h1>
            <h6 class="text-justify">Montessori classrooms are peaceful, happy places designed to meet the developmental needs of each child
                in every stage of life.</h6>
            
            <img src="images/insideclass.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="Classroom" id="imgClass1">

            <p class="text-justify">They contain many places for children to learn and play, in many different ways: by
                themselves, in pairs, in
                small groups, in large groups, inside, outside, at tables, on the floor. All items in the environment
                are
                scaled to the child's size, including furniture, shelves, utensils, dishware, cleaning implements and
                the
                Montessori materials themselves. There is no focal center to the classroom; this reflects that the
                teacher
                is not the focus of the children's attention, but that they are all one community together. Bright and
                attractive colors, natural materials, fascinating cultural objects and interesting pictures on the wall
                all
                offer the children complex sensory and intellectual experiences. When children first enter a Montessori
                environment, there is an immediate and touching moment when they realize that this place is for them.
            </p>


            <p class="text-justify">In Montessori classrooms, children are taught how to regulate their own social
                interactions. Through fun
                role-playing activities and appropriate modeling, the teacher demonstrates the best way to respond to
                arguments or new situations, giving the child the ability to act confidently and pro-socially when the
                actual problem arises. The result is a self-regulating classroom, in which natural social tensions are
                resolved mostly by the children themselves.</p>

            <img src="images/insideclass2.jpg" class="rounded float-left" alt="Classroom2" id="imgClass2">

            <p class="text-justify"> Children move freely throughout the environment, choosing activities that interest
                them, or working with the
                teacher, individually, or in small groups. Their movement is unrestricted by the teacher unless it
                endangers
                themselves, other people, or their surroundings. Outdoor environments are important in Montessori
                schools,
                and offer opportunities to engage with the natural world.</p>

            <h6 class="text-justify"><b>Guiding Principles: </b> guiding principles of Montessori education are the same across all age levels,
                and

            <img src="images/respect.jpg" alt="Respct" class="img-fluid" id="imgRespct">

            <p class="text-justify"> Maria Montessori profoundly respected children and the developmental powers that
                drive them to seek certain
                experiences. Montessori education reframes the adult/child relationship to place the child at the center
                of
                his own learning. In Montessori classrooms, teachers respect children as separate and unique
                individuals.
                They guide children to respect the people and objects in their environment, and as the child grows
                older, to
                respect and understand the connectedness between all living and non-living things, leading to the
                adolescent's profound awareness of the complex web of human existence.</p>

            <h2>PREPARED ENVIRONMENT</h2>
            <img src="images/prepared.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Prepared" class="img-fluid"
            id="imgPrepared">

            <p class="text-justify"> Children's needs change as they move through stages of development. At each level
                of Montessori education,
                this difference is honored through the preparation of the classroom environment. The environment is
                prepared
                in every way for optimal development: physically, cognitively, socially and emotionally. By aligning the
                activities in the environment with what each child needs at any moment, Montessori prepared environments
                liberate children's energy for growth and learning. </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> HANDS-ON LEARNING
            </h2>
            <p class="text-justify"> Montessori classrooms are interactive environments in which hands-on exploration is
                not only encouraged, it
                is necessary. By using the mind, the body, and the senses, learning becomes an activity that engages the
                whole self. Any parent will agree that children do; Montessori environments follow this natural
                inclination
                of children towards activity by offering an appropriate variety of objects and activities for meaningful
                engagement.

            id="imgDescovery">

            <p class="text-justify">One of the most profound differences between Montessori education and conventional
                education is that, in
                Montessori, children are given the experience of discovering the answer for themselves. This leads to a
                much
                deeper learning experience, and creates a lifelong love of learning as a self-directed process of
                problem-solving and discovery.

            id="imgImagi">
            <p class="text-justify"> Montessori classrooms support the development of imagination and creativity at
                every stage of learning. The
                open-ended activities allow children to explore new ideas and relationships, providing a foundation for
                self-expression and innovation. In the early years, the building blocks of imagination are firmly
                established through sensory exploration of the world, launching both imagination and creative
                self-expression.</p>

            <h2>FREEDOM OF CHOICE </h2>
            <p class="text-justify"> Maria Montessori recognized that when allowed freedom of choice within clear, firm
                and reasonable
                boundaries, children act in positive ways that further their development. Freedom is frequently
                misunderstood, and many people take it to mean that children can do whatever they want. Montessori
                believed
                that freedom without boundaries was abandonment. In Montessori classrooms, expectations are clear, and
                children experience the natural and logical consequences of their choices. This freedom within limits
                allows
                for the natural development of self-regulation within the society of the classroom, as well as mirroring
                behaviors expected by society in general.</p>

            <h2> INDEPENDENCE </h2>
            <img src="images/independence.jpg" alt=" Independe" class="img-fluid"
            id="imgIndepen">

            <p class="text-justify"> From the moment of birth onwards, humans strive towards independence. Children feel
                this need very strongly;
                they want to do things for themselves, and to participate in the world around them. In Montessori
                classrooms, this natural drive towards independence is fostered through practical, social and
                intellectual
                experiences. The child becomes an active agent in her own education, saying, “Help me to do it myself”.
                We
                honor this by helping children move to increasingly higher levels of independence and self-reliance.

            <h1>PARENT RESOURCES
            </h1>
            <h6 class="text-justify">Montessori's goals for children are often in alignment with a parent's own goals for their children:
                that
                children respect and care for the people and things around them, have fun while they learn, and take
                responsibility for their actions.</h6>

                <br>
            <h2> Child Development and Montessori 
            </h2>
            <p class="text-justify"> School should offer children more than just academic skills. It should help them
                grow into confident,
                independent, caring and self-motivated people. The goal of Montessori education is to develop the whole
                person; someone who is more than the sum of their test scores.

                Equally important to the Montessori experience is the growth of the child's character. Montessori
                teachers
                strive to engender in the child a sense of responsibility and the connectedness of people and things.
                Children learn that their choices have consequences, not only in their immediate interpersonal
                relationships, but also in the world at large. By allowing safe consequences to flow freely from the
                child's
                choice, he learns to exert control over himself to limit negative results and promote positive ones.
                This
                development of executive function, most particularly self-regulation, is at the core of the child's
                drive
                towards confidence and independence.</p>

                <br>
            <h2> Offering choices </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Encouraging your child to make choices at an early age is one of the most powerful
                gifts a parent can offer.
                Giving choices fosters independence, cooperation and experience with natural consequences. This can be
                done
                in many ways. For a very young child, it can be as simple as, “Would you like to wear the blue shirt or
                the
                red shirt today?” This technique of offering choices can be extended into all parts of the child's life,
                growing in relation to her abilities, and leading to development of executive function and
                self-regulation.
